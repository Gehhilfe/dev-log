In a current project, I am faced with a common distributed system problem. I have a 
set of thousands, long-running jobs, for which a single job doesn't need many resources. 
Also, these jobs mostly wait for arriving data. But the processing load is too much for a
single virtual machine. Therefore, horizontal scaling over multiple machine or containers 
is needed and unfortunately the data needs to be processed in order, but the data can be 
partitioned in independent order streams of data. Each of these independent data streams 
I want to assign to a smaller set of processing nodes, but to ensure that ordering is 
kept it is only allowed a stream is processed on a single node. 

To solve these kinds of problems, a set of distributed algorithms is needed. 
But luckily, most of these problems are already solved by Kubernetes. That is why investigate 
solutions to create a custom Kubernetes operator, which can leverage these implemented distributed
algorithms.

## Kubernetes Operator

A Kubernetes operators is software extending the Kubernetes control plane. Usually operators are using
custom resources to describe and configure their components. Operators are following the Kubernetes 
control loop, by comparing the current state to the desired state.

## Operator-SDK

Operator SDK provides tools and packages to easily build Kubernetes operators. It supports three ways of developing operators:

- Ansible based
- Helm based
- Go based

The ansible and helm approach is the recommended way of creating simple operators, but this way has some limits in functionality.
Basically, it is limited to a one-to-one mapping between custom resource and other resources. For example, you can create a custom resource 
which maps onto a helm chart. This simplifies the deployment and update of deployed helm applications.

But this is not enough functionality to solve my scheduling of N task onto M execution units “pods”. Therefore, I choose the go operator way.

## Go based operators

First of all, you should have read the operator sdk [tutorial](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/golang/tutorial/), because it gives a broad overview of the project structure and teaches the basic operator operations and how to deploy an operator on a cluster.

Some problems I encountered during using the operator-sdk:

- You don't need to deploy the operator to your cluster!
    - It is possible to execute it locally
- Use finalizers to control what happens if a custom resource is deleted
- Field selectors are limited to name and namespace
    - Label selectors are more flexible

Creating operators is complicated, specially when it is need to include state outside of Kubernetes. This is a problem 
I still try to solve. What happens when an assigned task is successfully accepted by processing pod, but this pods never makes any process.
My approach is to use health checks, that mark pods which are no processing unhealthy.
