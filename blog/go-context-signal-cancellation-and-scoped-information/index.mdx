The go programming concurrency context pattern allows to communicate 
cancellation and information from top to bottom. Often a goroutine creates multiple 
other goroutine. A http or RPC server will create for every request a separated 
goroutine and this goroutine is provide as first parameter a 
[Context](https://pkg.go.dev/context#Context). Should the client cancel the request,
than provide context will also be canceled. This is result in that all from this request
created goroutine will also be canceled.

To achieve this functionality we are responsible to forward the context to all created 
goroutines. Furthermore, we should derive a new context that may has a timeout and 
can be canceled.

```go
func subroutine(ctx context.Context) int {
    ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(ctx)
    defer cancel() // cancel derived context when we are done
    ch := make(chan int) // create channel for return values
    go producer(ctx, ch)

    // we care only for this first value
    return <- ch
}
```

Lets have a short look at the producer function. It will generate a series of increasing 
int values until the provided context is considered done, e.g. canceled or timed out.

```go
func producer(ctx context.Context, dst chan int) {
    n := 1
    for {
        select {
        case <-ctx.Done():
            return // return when context is done, ensures goroutine is not leaking
        case dst <- n:
            n++
        }
    }
}
```

Context can also be used to communicate information down chain. This sometimes used 
to transfer a logger instance. To add information 
`ctx = context.WithValue(ctx, key, value)` can be used and to retrieve information 
`ctx.Value(key).(*Type)` should be used.

To create a new context without any timeout or cancellation `context.Background()` 
is there for our rescue.

```go
package main

import (
  "context"
  "fmt"
  "time"
)

func subroutine(ctx context.Context) int {
  ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(ctx)
  defer cancel()       // cancel derived context when we are done
  ch := make(chan int) // create channel for return values
  go producer(ctx, ch)

  // we care only for this first value
  return <-ch
}

func producer(ctx context.Context, dst chan int) {
  n := 1
  for {
    select {
    case <-ctx.Done():
      fmt.Println("cleanup")
      return // return when context is done, ensures goroutine is not leaking
    case dst <- n:
      n++
    }
  }
}

func main() {
  ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
  defer cancel()

  r := subroutine(ctx)
  fmt.Println("Result:", r)
  time.Sleep(30 * time.Second)
}

```

Example on [go playground](https://go.dev/play/p/4stWKS5ssvi)

```bash
Result: 1
cleanup

Program exited.
```

We can clearly see that the producer goroutine finished 
when the context was canceled. As you can imagine this pattern
can be applied to all sorts of long running goroutines.
