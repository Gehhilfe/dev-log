Adding dynamic content, like a ‚ÄúLike Button‚Äù including a counter, to a static page seems 
to be contradictory. The current count, aka state of the dynamic content, can't be generated
statically. Therefore, an external state storage is need. To connect the static pages with our
state store a simple Web API is need. To keep maintenance as low as possible, I decided to use
only serverless technology. I don't want to maintain database servers or complex deployments.
For my small blog is this even also coast effective solution. My serverless [API project](https://github.com/Gehhilfe/dev-log-api) 
on GitHub.

### Like State Storage 

To store the like count of every blog entry, I decided to use DynamoDB from AWS. This provides
a cheap and serverless way to access data by a primary key. Furthermore, DynamoDB
even supports atomic operations! This ensures super accurate like count values. üòÅ

I configured a single table with a string primary key called `id` without a sort key and provisioned
a single read and write capacity unit, because I don't expect any high traffic and this limits also
the maximal cost.


**Table Configuration**

```typescript
export default {
  LikeTable: {
    Type: 'AWS::DynamoDB::Table',
    DeletionPolicy: 'Retain',
    Properties: {
      TableName: '${self:provider.environment.LIKE_TABLE}',
      AttributeDefinitions: [ { AttributeName: 'id', AttributeType: 'S' } ],
      KeySchema: [ { AttributeName: 'id', KeyType: 'HASH' } ],
      ProvisionedThroughput: {
        ReadCapacityUnits: '${self:custom.table_throughput}',
        WriteCapacityUnits: '${self:custom.table_throughput}'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Accessing and Modifying Likes

Creating a Web API with AWS Lambda and [serverless framework](https://www.serverless.com/) is quite straightforward. As
a starting point, I used the serverless [typescript plugin](https://www.serverless.com/plugins/serverless-plugin-typescript) 
and followed the short description to generate a new project.

I added two handler functions:

- [getLike](https://github.com/Gehhilfe/dev-log-api/blob/fdc0b9d0d0bc4218054a6aef52c98a8aca1631ae/src/functions/get-like/handler.ts) to retrieve the like count
  - Expects `id` as url parameter
- [postLike](https://github.com/Gehhilfe/dev-log-api/blob/fdc0b9d0d0bc4218054a6aef52c98a8aca1631ae/src/functions/like/handler.ts) to increment the like count
  - Expects a json body with an `id` and `clientId` property

The clientId is used to limit the likes of a single clientId to a maximum of 10 likes. You can try this by pressing the like button at the 
end of this article.

### Creating an React Like Button Component

To simplify development of a graphical React component, I extracted [helping functions](https://github.com/Gehhilfe/dev-log/blob/31bfc0a1cbdc299463e5c7b0d31b6f8c33b59eea/src/services/like.tsx) to interact with the API. The `LikeButton`
component as functional component that uses `useState` to store the like count on client side and further uses `useEffect` with
an empty dependency list to load the current like count. I designed the graphics with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/UAoI5lRqwL3t1xNKnVV54J/Heart?node-id=0%3A1)
and animated the SVG's with [react-spring](https://react-spring.io/basics).

You can check out my like [button component](https://github.com/Gehhilfe/dev-log/blob/31bfc0a1cbdc299463e5c7b0d31b6f8c33b59eea/src/components/like-button.tsx) on GitHub.


I hope this short description of my journey extending a static generated blog with a dynamic like button helps to include
dynamic content in your static projects. And now start liking my articles if they helped you.
